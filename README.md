# stock_portfolio
Extremely simpe stock portfolio manager that helps the user track investments

NOTE: It is recommended that the user, after finishing his list doesn't forget to save his file, so that it can be opened later. 
Editing a file is still on the way

Functions of the programs:
1 - shows all the investments the user has made
2 - adds a new investment to the list
3 - shows the total amount of money in invested stocks
4 - saves the current list of investments to a file
5 - loads a file containing invesetments
6 - exits the program
